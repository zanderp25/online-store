## Description

This is a concept for an online store made for CAP 4104: Human Computer Interaction. This store is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate based on the principles of HCI. The store is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on the user experience.

This work includes icons from the Dazzle Line Icons Collection by Dazzle UI, used under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://www.svgrepo.com/page/licensing/#CC%20Attribution). The icons are used for the purpose of this project and are not intended for commercial use.

This project also includes `react`, `react-dom`, and `babel` js modules because npm hates me for some reason.
